Recording software
==========================


FlyHostel uses [baslerpi](https://github.com/shaliulab/baslerpi) to interact with the cameras and `ffmpeg` to save the video data in a memory efficient format.

`baslerpi` is a wrapper library around `pypylon`, the Python module produced by Basler (the camera supplier) to drive the cameras.
